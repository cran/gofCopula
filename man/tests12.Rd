\title{2 and 3 dimensional gof test based on the in-and-out-of-sample approach
}
\description{
\code{gofPIOSTn} tests a 2 or 3 dimensional dataset with the PIOS test for a copula. The possible copulae are \code{"normal"}, \code{"t"}, \code{"clayton"}, \code{"gumbel"} and \code{"frank"}. The parameter estimation is performed with pseudo maximum likelihood method. In case the estimation fails, inversion of Kendall's tau is used. The approximate p-values are computed with a semiparametric bootstrap, which computation can be accelerated by enabling in-build parallel computation.
}
\usage{
gofPIOSTn(copula, x, param = 0.5, param.est = TRUE, df = 4, df.est = TRUE, 
          margins = "ranks", M = 1000, dispstr = "ex", m = 1, 
          seed.active = NULL, processes = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{copula}{
The copula to test for. Possible are the copulae \code{"normal"}, \code{"t"}, \code{"clayton"}, \code{"gumbel"} and \code{"frank"}.
}
 \item{x}{
A matrix containing the data. 
}
  \item{param}{
The parameter to be used.
}
\item{param.est}{
Shall be either \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}. \code{TRUE} means that \code{param} will be estimated with a maximum likelihood estimation.
}
\item{df}{
Degrees of freedom, if not meant to be estimated. Only necessary if tested for \code{"t"}-copula. For computational reasons the entry is limited to 60 degrees of freedom.
}
\item{df.est}{
Indicates if \code{df} shall be estimated. Has to be either \code{FALSE} or \code{TRUE}, where \code{TRUE} means that it will be estimated. For computational reasons the estimate is limited to 60 degrees of freedom.
}
\item{margins}{
Specifies which estimation method for the margins shall be used. The default is \code{"ranks"}, which is the standard approach to convert data in such a case. Alternatively the following distributions can be specified: \code{"beta"}, \code{"cauchy"}, Chi-squared (\code{"chisq"}), \code{"f"}, \code{"gamma"}, Log normal (\code{"lnorm"}), Normal (\code{"norm"}), \code{"t"}, \code{"weibull"}, Exponential (\code{"exp"}). Input can be either one method, e.g. \code{"ranks"}, which will be used for estimation of all data sequences. Also an individual method for each margin can be specified, e.g. \code{c("ranks", "norm", "t")} for 3 data sequences. If one does not want to estimate the margins, set it to \code{NULL}.
}
  \item{M}{
Number of bootstrapping loops.
}
\item{dispstr}{
A character string specifying the type of the symmetric positive definite matrix characterizing the elliptical copula. Implemented structures are "ex" for exchangeable and "un" for unstructured, see package \code{copula}.
}
\item{m}{
Length of blocks.
}
\item{seed.active}{
Has to be either an integer or a vector of M+1 integers. If an integer, then the seeds for the bootstrapping procedure will be simulated. If M+1 seeds are provided, then these seeds are used in the bootstrapping procedure. Defaults to \code{NULL}, then \code{R} generates the seeds from the computer runtime. Controlling the seeds is useful for reproducibility of a simulation study to compare the power of the tests or for reproducibility of an empirical study.
}
\item{processes}{
The number of parallel processes which are performed to speed up the bootstrapping. Shouldn't be higher than the number of logical processors. Please see the details.}
}
\details{
The "Tn" test is introduced in Zhang et al. (2015). It tests the \eqn{H_0}{H0} hypothesis
\deqn{H_0 : C_0 \in \mathcal{C}.}{H0 : C0 in Ccal.}
For the test blocks of length \code{m} are constructed out of the data. The test compares then the pseudo likelihood of the data in each block with the overall parameter and with the parameter by leaving out the data in the block. By this procedure can be determined if the data in the block influence the parameter estimation significantly. The test statistic is defined as
\deqn{T = \sum_{b=1}^M \sum_{k=1}^m [l\{U_k^b;\theta_n \} - l\{U_k^b;\theta_n^{-b} \}]}{T = sum(sum(l(U_k^b;theta_n ) - l(U_k^b;theta_n^(-b) ), k=1, ...,m ), b=1, ...,B)}

with the pseudo observations \eqn{U_{ij}}{U[ij]} for \eqn{i = 1, \dots,n}{i = 1, ...,n}; \eqn{j = 1, \dots,d}{j = 1, ...,d} and
\deqn{\theta_n = \arg \min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^n l(U_i; \theta)}{theta_n = arg max_theta sum(l(U_i; theta), i=1, ..., n)}
and
\deqn{\theta_n^{-b} = \arg \min_{\theta} \sum_{b^{'} \neq b}^M \sum_{i=1}^m l(U_i^{b^{'}}; \theta), b=1, \dots, M.}{theta_n^(-b) = arg max_theta sum(sum(l(U_i^(b^'); theta), i=1, ..., m), b^'=1, ..., M, b^' != b), b = 1, ..., M.}

The approximate p-value is computed by the formula
\deqn{\sum_{b=1}^M \mathbf{I}(|T_b| \geq |T|) / M,}{sum(|T[b]| >= |T|, b=1, .., M) / M,}

The applied estimation method is the two-step pseudo maximum likelihood approach, see Genest and Rivest (1995).

For small values of \code{M}, initializing the parallelisation via \code{processes} does not make sense. The registration of the parallel processes increases the computation time. Please consider to enable parallelisation just for high values of \code{M}.
